1. Add all projects (microservices) creating and configuring all connections after adding each one. 
List of the microservices is in Architecture description.
Test each connection after adding. Content of connections doesn't matter on this stage, let it be "test".

2. Create an easily runnable testing script that would check if all microservices communicate well.

3. Formalise all interfaces of connections. Write down use scenarios, 
and see on paper that the planned connection interfaces are working.

4. Implement connections using respective technologies, test that they all work.

5. Modify the connection testing script to see all interfaces match each other.

6. Create test projects and implement logic in services using TDD.

7. Implement auth/auth.

8. Cover connections etc with integration tests.
